# A left rotation operation on an array of size  shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left. For example, if left rotations are performed on array , then the array would become .

# Given an array of  integers and a number, , perform  left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.

# Input Format
# The first line contains two space-separated integers denoting the respective values of  (the number of integers) and  (the number of left rotations you must perform). 
# The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective elements of the array's initial state.

# Sample Input
# 5 4
# 1 2 3 4 5

# Sample Output
# 5 1 2 3 4

# Explanation
# When we perform  left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:
# Thus, we print the array's final state as a single line of space-separated values, which is 5 1 2 3 4.
